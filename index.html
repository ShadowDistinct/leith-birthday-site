                <h3>How we met</h3>
                <p>We first met eachother in a Roblox game called "Write a letter" where i as usual harrassed people, when i layed my eyes on you i thought nothing special about you until you and youre sister together sent me a friend request in which i reluctantly accepted, which in a way you could say changed my life (Even though we've only talked to eachother for like a week idk i easily forget stuff). and then you out of the blue randomly asked what i was doing and if i was bored. As per usual you always say cool (fuck you) and you know i joined u in that refrigerator or whatever its called, and you know i never really thought much about it you know, im not sure if you know this but when i first met you and youre sister i have my eyes on you specifically (NOT BECAUSE YOU USE BOOBS ON UR AVATAR). And i always suspected you having a penis, im not disappointed infact im very happy about it when you told me about it haha. after that the next day you invited me to play another game in which you have me tortured by either flinging me or trapping me in a cage. and then i asked for ur discord in which u declined so i ask ur sister in which, idk why she said yes and when i asked her for ur discord she emphasizes SHE when i asked about ur discord, she said you didnt have one so i accepted it, the next day i pressured you to adding me on discord. thats it thats our story very cool i know.</p>

                        <p>One of my favorite moments together is when we played roblox for an entire day on a weekend, it helped me distract myself from my problems and also my homework haha. Its always fun playing with you except when we play the el cuando game or whatever üò°. I also love it when we harassed that person in the flinging game together and made him quit haha you were pretty good at uhh fighting him while i was doing my own stuff hehe </p>
